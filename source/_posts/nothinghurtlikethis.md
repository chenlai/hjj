you keep digging pushing driving like a hammer hitting in my head space.

if this is a condition is sadistic.

i would say it is the worst case .

it is just another fight never you never me never right.

nothing hurts like this.

feels as good as your kiss.

when i strip down with you,

i feel this love is barrow through another level never was perfection.

say what you konw how to know the keys that crushed me for attention.
